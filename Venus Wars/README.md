#About the Game 
The screen displays a single player capable of shooting projectiles at the enemy. 
Upon the projectile hitting the enemy, the enemy respawns at a random location. 
To track the score, I have added a score board at top. 

#How to Play
To play this you would need python and pygame installed. 
To install pygame simply open up command window and type -m pip install pygame if you are using IDLE. 
In case of an editor like PyCharm, there's a direct option available to install pygame. 

Enjoy !
